# Chess_Piece_Recognition
This project focuses on developing a computer vision model to identify chess pieces in real time. By using neural networks, the model will recognize various chess pieces such as rooks, bishops, and queens from images. The objective is to convert live chess games into a digital format, facilitating both analysis and live streaming.

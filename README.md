# Chess_Piece_Recognition
This project focuses on developing a computer vision model to identify chess pieces in real time. By using neural networks, the model will recognize various chess pieces such as knight, king, pawn, rooks,bishops, and queens from images. The objective is to convert live chess games into a digital format that could be used for analysis and live streaming.

# Project Objective
create a computer vision in order to classify chess piece to help turn a real chess game into a virtual chess game. this model with use computer vision which is used to train computer to be able to recognize images based on certain characteristics. the model will utilize a sequential model and also vgg19 model for its improvement.

# Methods Used
- os
- numpy
- pandas
- splitfolder
- cv2
- glob
- matplotlib
- squarify
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- sklearn

# Project Description
This project was created to identify the a chess piece using computer vision. this program will try to predict the type of piece using numerous data of picture of chess pieces such as rooks, bishops, queen, etc. this is done in order to help turn a game of real life chess into a digital format in order to help in analysis or as a means of livestreaming it to the public. after the creation of the computer vision, it will be uploaded into hugging face in order to be used for other predictions.
